<p>This is a list of chicken dishes. 
Chicken is the most common type of poultry in the world,[1] 
and was one of the first domesticated animals. 
Chicken is a major worldwide source of meat and eggs for human consumption.
 It is prepared as food in a wide variety of ways, varying by region and culture. 
The prevalence of chickens is due to almost the entire chicken being edible, and the ease of raising them.

Chicken as a meat has been depicted in Babylonian carvings from around 600 BC.
[2] Chicken was one of the most common meats available in the Middle Ages.
[citation needed] It was eaten over most of the Eastern hemisphere and a number of different kinds of chicken such as capons,
 pullets and hens were eaten. It was one of the basic ingredients in the so-called white dish, 
a stew usually consisting of chicken and fried onions cooked in milk and seasoned with spices and sugar.
his article is about fried chicken in the cuisine of the Southern United States. For fried chicken in the
 Cantonese cuisine of Southern China and Hong Kong, see crispy fried chicken. For fried chicken prepared Korea-style, 
see Korean fried chicken.

Southern fried chicken, also known simply as fried chicken, 
is a dish consisting of chicken pieces which have been coated in a seasoned batter and pan-fried, 
deep fried, or pressure fried. The breading adds a crisp coating or crust to the exterior of the chicken while 
retaining juices in the meat. Broiler chickens are most commonly used.

The first dish known to have been deep fried was fritters, which were popular 
in the European Middle Ages. However, it was the Scottish who were the first Europeans to deep
 fry their chicken in fat (though without seasoning). Meanwhile, a number of West African peoples had
 traditions of seasoned fried chicken (though battering and cooking the chicken in palm oil). Scottish frying 
techniques and West African seasoning techniques were combined by enslaved Africans and African-Americans in the American South.
 you haven't already) Create a GitHub.com account and a repository that you will use for this class.

(If you haven't already) Follow the Development Setup Video (beginning of Module 1) instructions on how to create a repository and set it up such that you can host and view your finished web pages on GitHub Pages, i.e., GitHub.io domain name. You will need to provide that URL for your peer review.

Create a folder in your repository that will serve as a container folder for your solution to this assignment. You can call it whatever you want. For example, module3-solution or mod3_solution, etc. Create an index.html file inside the solution container folder, e.g., module3-solution/index.html.

The implementation of the page you will be creating should follow the mockup illustrations shown below. You are provided 3 mockups: desktop and tablet (same), mobile, and mobile with mobile menu dropdown shown. Your implementation has to be JUST 1 page. In other words, you will be creating a single, responsive page.

Your page must include a CSS file. No inline styles allowed. Your CSS file should be placed into a css folder under the solution container folder, e.g., module3-solution/css.

For this assignment, you are to use Twitter Bootstrap CSS Framework as much as possible. I suggest you start with copying the starter bootstrap files and folders we discussed in Lecture 25 part 2. If you've cloned/downloaded the code example repository, it should be in the examples/Lecture25 folder. Copy the contents of examples/Lecture25 to your solution container folder (e.g., module3-solution) as a starting point..

Since we are using Bootstrap for this assignment, instead of specifying pixel ranges, I will define our desktop, tablet, and mobile views in terms of Bootstrap CSS class prefixes, i.e., md, sm, and xs.

Desktop mockup illustration should correspond to Bootstrap md-based classes
Tablet mockup illustration should correspond to Bootstrap sm-based classes
Mobile mockup illustration should correspond to Bootstrap xs-based classes
Navbar: Create a navbar that scrolls away together with the page (the navbar should become invisible and is not fixed to the top when you scroll the page down). The navbar should have a company name (i.e., navbar-brand class) called "Food, LLC" that is aligned to the left side of the navbar. (See https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/components/#navbar. Make the browser window narrower to see the mobile menu button appear in the first example shown at the provided link.)

For desktop and tablet view, the navbar should not contain anything else. No other buttons should be visible. (Hint: use 'visible-xs' class.)

Navbar - Mobile View: Create a simple menu button (3 horizontal bars). When the user clicks that button, a dropdown menu should appear (as illustrated in Mobile Open Menu illustration below.) The dropdown menu should contain 3 items: Chicken, Beef, and Sushi.

The dropdown menu should take up the entire width of the browser window. Make sure the dropdown menu has a background color set that distinguishes it from the rest of the content.
